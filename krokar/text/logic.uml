Logic
---
 - *graphics: Graphics          --  The graphics object (when placed in logic, make sure it gets a pointer to mouseCoords)
 - *world: World                --  Your map
 - *units: UnitHandler          --  Something to stick your units in. Could be a simple 2D array
 - *buildings: BuildingHandler  --  Same as units. Could be a 2D array.
 - mouseCoords: MouseCoords     --  The coordinates of the mouse (see above)

                                --  This is where you'd put things like menu handlers,
                                --  and whatever else you might want in the game.

 + Logic()
 + Logic(&graphics, &world, &units, &buildings)
 
 + setWorld(world): void      --  You can make set functions for most of the members if you think you'll need them.
 + setGraphics(graphics): void       --  The constructor is able to handle it, though.

 - updateMouseCoords(x, y): void   --  Update the mouse position (called from run() when the mouse moves)
 - handleMouseClick(button): void  --  Not sure if you want to be able to drag and drop things. This function may or may not work for you.

 + run(): void            --  update everything, call graphics.draw(), sleep to maintain fps
